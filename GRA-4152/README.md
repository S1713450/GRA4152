## Packages
Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a tool to visualize the design, or architecture, of (complex) software systems. Just like classes in OOP. We can generate UML diagrams for `Python` classes using the library `pylint`, which uses `graphviz` to generate `png` or `pdf` files showing the architecture of a given class. 
```bash
pip install pylint
sudo apt install graphviz
pyreverse -o png <your code>.py
```

## Honor Code
You are free to form study groups and may discuss homework in groups. However, each student must write down the solutions and code from scratch independently and must understand the solution well enough. It is a honor code violation to copy, refer to, or look at written or code solutions from a previous year or solutions posted online (inspired by the Stanford Honor Code).
